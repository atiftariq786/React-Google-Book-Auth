# Google-Book-Search
This is a full-stack MERN application,which allows users to search for book titles and retrieve information about them by utilizing the Google Books API. It relies on a MongoDB database for data persistence, Express for routing from my server, React for serving up and manipulating front-end content, and Node as its runtime environment. Users can navigate between the search page, where they can search for and examine different books, and the saved page, where they can see any books they've chosen to add to their collection. They also have the option of deleting a book from their saved collection after they've added it, which will update the database accordingly.
